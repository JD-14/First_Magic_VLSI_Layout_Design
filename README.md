# First Magic VLSI Layout Design

This repository contains the work of my first magic layouts using the **SkyWater 130nm** technology. 
The following layouts are not optimized for area reduction.
This work presents the approach I used to learn how to draw the following layouts using the open-source **Magic VLSI Layout Tool**.
Moreover, the netlist of each layout was extracted to conduct a Layout vs. Schematic analysis later.

# Circuit Layouts:
  1. [Inverter]()
  2. [NAND Gate]()
  3. [NOR Gate]()
